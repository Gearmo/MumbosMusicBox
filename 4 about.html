                <p>
                Welcome to Mumbo's Musicbox! This is a <b>music database</b> website that holds music files compatible with the game "Banjo-Kazooie". This is mainly a quick-access tool for modders to find music for their levels, or for people simply searching for good video game music.
                <br><br>
                Our directory consists of music from other game series, such as Mario, Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and others. This sort of variety offers loads of fun for modders and players alike, enriching their ROM hack experience through nostalgia and musical innovation.
                <br><br>
                Banjo-Kazooie is a game centralized around its music, which is clear from the hundreds of musical notes that are to be collected, and from the cheeriness of the Grant Kirkhope's music. Our goal is to preserve that charm and elevate the ideas of our incredibly talented modders through rich, captivating, and atmospheric music.

                <div class="content"><h1>FAQ</h1>

                <p><b>Q) What file types are supported?<br></b>
                A) Right now, our main files types we support are MP3, MIDI, and MCSZ files. These files are crucial to the development of BK modding, and helps everyone find the music regardless of musical knowledge.</p>

                <p><b>Q) Why do your MIDI files sound so bad?<br></b>
                A) MIDI files are the only compatible music files that can be imported into Banjo's Backpack. Since Banjo-Kazooie's original music wasn't written in MIDI format, the in-game tracks and the MIDI files aren't 1-to-1. For example, the MIDI-track named "Flute" will not play a Flute sound in-game, but a track named "Harpsichord" <i>will</i> play back the sound of a Flute. Visit the <a href="3 composition.html">Composition</a> tab for more information.</p>

                <p><b>Q) What is a MCSZ file?<br></b>
                A) MSCZ files are music notation files used in MuseScore, which is one of the most popular notation software available for musicians. If you are interested in composing music for yourself, I would likely recommend using MuseScore. It has a relatively easy interface compared to other notation programs, and does not require a musical background to get started with. Visit the <a href="3 composition.html">Composition</a> tab for more information.</p>

                <p><b>Q) What is this "Banjo's Backpack" you keep mentioning?<br></b>
                A) Banjo's Backpack is a modding software that allows for the modification of the levels, music, enemies, and objects found within Banjo-Kazooie. It allows the import of 3D models, MIDI files, and has the settings to tweak in-game behavior such as in-game text, enemy boundaries, camera triggers, etc. And in case you're wondering, no, Banjo's Backpack does not support Banjo-Tooie modding. More information can be found on their <a href="https://github.com/banjobackpack/Banjo-s-Backpack"> GitHub </a> directory.</p>

                <p><b>Q) Where can I find level models for Banjo's Backpack?<br></b>
                A) As of right now, our website is only hosting music files for mod use. Maybe in the future we will implement models for stages, characters, and objects. Stay tuned! </p>
