_The MIDI database for Banjo-Kazooie modding._

## Purpose
Mumbo's Music Box holds music files that can be implemented into Banjo-Kazooie modding programs, such as [Banjo's Backpack](https://github.com/banjobackpack/Banjo-s-Backpack). The purpose is to have a quick-access website for modders to download music that they need for their stages. Mumbo's Music Box focuses on music from other games series, such as Pokemon, Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Touhou, etc.

## Supported Files
> MIDI
* Perhaps the most important file on this website, .midi files can be directly implemented into Banjo's Backpack for custom music. Our databse fo. They are readily available to import into Banjo's Backpack, and have been tested before finalizing. Keep in mind that these files will sound off -- that is because of their respective .midi assignment track, which will be corrected once they are imported into the game. More information can be accessed in the website under "MIDI Assingment" (TBA).

> MP3
* Our .mp3 files give a brief preview of how a song should sound IN-GAME. Similar to MIDI files, these are simply approximations and may sound different in-game than their preview. See the "Building" tab for more information on how these .mp3 files are built.

> MSCZ
* These are score files that are supported by MuseScore, a free open-source scorewriter supported by most operating systems. This makes it easy for musicians to score out and make edits to files if needed. It also makes it easy to export to other file types, such as .xml, .midi, .mp3, .pdf, and so on. These files can easy be imported to other notation software like Sibelius or Finale.

## Categories
The website is split up into the following categories:
> Game
* Self-explanatory. If you are looking for a song from a specific game, sort by this category. If you do not find a song you are looking for, you can always ask for one under the "request" tab (TBA).

> Series
* Similar to the above, this helps with finding songs from specific series, such as Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, etc.

> Length
* This sorting method helps with finding music with varying lengths. Although there are no known limiations regarding track length, some modders prefer shorter loops for certain parts of their stages. Others prefer 6-minute loops for some reason (ahem, One Winged Angel).

> Genre
* Use this sorting method to help fit the aesthetic or vibe of your stage (specific genres TBA).

> Type
* Some songs may come with variants, such as indoors, underwater, or boss themes. This category will help sort those, if they are provided.
