_The MIDI database for Banjo-Kazooie modding._

## Purpose
Mumbo's Music Box holds music files that can be implemented into Banjo-Kazooie modding programs, such as [Banjo's Backpack](https://github.com/banjobackpack/Banjo-s-Backpack). The purpose is to have a quick-access website for modders to download music that they need for their stages. Mumbo's Music Box focuses on music from other games series, such as Pokemon, Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Touhou, etc.

* Our .mp3 files give a brief preview of how a song should sound IN-GAME. Similar to MIDI files, these are simply approximations and may sound different in-game than their preview. See the "Building" tab for more information on how these .mp3 files are built.
> MSCZ
* These are score files that are supported by MuseScore, a free open-source scorewriter supported by most operating systems. This makes it easy for musicians to score out and make edits to files if needed. It also makes it easy to export to other file types, such as .xml, .midi, .mp3, .pdf, and so on. These files can easy be imported to other notation software like Sibelius or Finale.
